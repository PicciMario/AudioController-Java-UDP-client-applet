AudioController

A java applet/application designed (but never used) to control an hardware device via UDP packets.

Built around a queue of UDP messages dispatched by a thread and pushed by custom UI elements, with optional wait for acknowledge.

Included a VERY simple java UDP server to simulate communications between the applet and the hardware.
